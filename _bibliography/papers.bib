abstract = {Atom interferometry-based sensors have demonstrated remarkable precision, making them attractive for diverse applications compared to traditional sensors. However, practical experiments inevitably encounter noise, which limits precision. We investigate the performance of two commonly used methods, ellipse fitting (EF) and fringe fitting (FF), for differential phase estimation in a dual atom interferometer under various noise conditions. We comprehensively analyze the efficacy of these methods for each type of Gaussian noise, including phase noise, amplitude noise, and offset noise. Using a colored noise model, we investigate the Allan deviation results. Our investigations will offer valuable insights for future quantum sensing based on dual interferometers.}

abstract = {Effective integration of optical modes within chip-scale devices is critical to realize functional light emission, as it offers abundant physics and a versatile ability to control the mode evolution. Here, we present an efficient approach to achieve switchable emission by flexibly controlling supermode states in a doubly-coupled-ring system with four guided modes. The lasing conditions, which rely on the system's Hamiltonian, are revealed to yield multiple supermode states, including an exceptional-point state, a (quasi-)dark state, and a bright state. By freely engineering the coupling rate via phase-change material, the proposed system allows the generation of any desired states, enabling switchable and multifunctional emissions in fixed on-chip structures. Beyond the manipulation of various supermode emission states, our work presents a promising path toward the development of multifunctional integrated photonic devices, which may have applications in light storage, optical isolation, sensing, and so on.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
